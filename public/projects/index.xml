      <description>Ok so this is how I made a dictionary based brute force attack
First i needed to find the targets ip-address. In this example its a simple server on my lan next I opened kali linux on virtual box and scanned what ports are open on the server by typing in this command nmap 192.168.1.116 after that I can see that ports 22 and 80 are open. Commonly 22 is used for remote access and 80 is used for http traffic after knowing this I can try bruteforcing ssh access In this case because I dont want to wait forever I have created a simpler list of passwords that might be the correct one.</description>

      <description>As a guy who loves to watch different movies and tv shows I created this static website do display the movies that i have watched over the years.
The website shows basic stats like the movie name, release date and a poster image. I also added to show the rating of what i though about that specific movie. This data is received using the TMDB (the movie database) apikey.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a very big Marvel fan myself. My favorites are doctor strange and Iron Man. One day I watched a youtube video and it showed how to build Iron man&amp;rsquo;s arc reactor using a 3d printer. I downloaded the file and immediately got excited about the project. To original video! In the first step, I actually started by printing the body of the arc reactor. Next I had to get an EL panel for my project.</description>
