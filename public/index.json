My favorites are doctor strange and Iron Man. One day I watched a youtube video and it showed how to build Iron man\u0026rsquo;s arc reactor using a 3d printer. I downloaded the file and immediately got excited about the project. To original video! In the first step, I actually started by printing the body of the arc reactor. Next I had to get an EL panel for my project. Huge thanks to Jari, who took care of it for me. Next, I started to cut the electric panel so that it fits the frame. The cutting instructions from the video were small as shown in the picture, so I had to draw my own. Next, Jari enlarged the holes in the back panel for me, because I was nervous that I would screw something up badly here. In the same class, I also filed the hole where the wires of the el panel are threaded to be bigger, and the frame to be put on it smaller so that it fits in the case. At the end of the class, I went to paint the work. With gray spray paint. At home I modeled how the finished work would look like. In the next lesson, I built a wire that takes electricity from the battery case that is in my pocket to the el panel. Here I used a soldering iron and a hot air blower. at home I filled the hole with this mass because the hole had to be made really big because the hole was blocked. In the next lesson, I soldered a connector to the el panel so I can easily separate the parts from each other. I also printed a stand for the reactor so I can display it on a shelf in my room. At home today, May 9, 2022, I started gluing the magnets to the back plate and the arc reactor itself, so that I can attach it to my shirt. Next, I added a film on top of the el panel, which brings a little more privacy to the light. I wiped the el panel with a microfiber cloth and then put the top part in place\u0026hellip; And WOW that looks amazing!
