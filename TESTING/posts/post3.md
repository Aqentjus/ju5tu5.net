As a guy who loves to watch different movies and tv shows I created this static website do display the movies that i have watched over the years.

The website shows basic stats like the movie name, release date and a poster image. I also added to show the rating of what i though about that specific movie. This data is received using the TMDB (the movie database) apikey.
