# New Website!

Description: New website and Why I created this
Content:

Ok so I have had few websites before this one but recently I switched to this, because I wanted to create a website from scratch that generates the content from markdown files. This website works using javascript that reads throung markdown files I have created and then generates the html elements. I wanted to build this because I don't want to edit the raw HTML code when adding new stuff and I don't want to use limiting software like hugo that I previously used.

previous hugo based website:
