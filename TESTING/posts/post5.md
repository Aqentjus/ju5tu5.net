Ok, so as a person who is interested in cybersecurity and constantly wants to keep track on what is currently happening on the field. I coded a simple rss reader in Javascript that you specify a rss feed url and it will read that and parse every heading into nice looking boxes so you can read easily the news and stuff happening on the field. Now it just read the rss read from https:/www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/ but I'm planning on adding more functionality to the website...

you can find the rss read from this url https:/www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/feed/rss/fi
